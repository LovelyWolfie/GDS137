It seems like you want to resolve a merge conflict or merge changes into the code. However, there are no visible merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) in the provided code. If you are encountering a merge conflict in your version control system (e.g., Git), you need to resolve it by editing the file to keep the desired changes.

If you want to merge or improve the code, let me know what specific changes or enhancements you'd like to make. For example:
- Fixing bugs
- Adding new features
- Refactoring the code for better readability or performance

Let me know how I can assist!
